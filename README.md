# Liam Mack Snyder - Dev Archive (WIP)

This is my personal GitHub archive repository. It includes code as well as diagrams and other items. When finished, it'll include code I've worked on in various languages and frameworks. For right now, the only folder that contains anything is the SQL folder. In the future it'll also include React Native,
Java and Python. I may also add Unity C# scripts, Lua scripts, and other languages I work in in the future, both for personal and school purposes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Platforms
The following tools and platforms were used in the creation of the diagrams, code, and any other items in this repo.
- VS Code
- Snowflake
- Draw.io
- MySQL Workbench
- ExpoGo
- Eclipse IDE
- Jupyter Notebook

## üìÇ Folders
- **SQL** - Draw.io and MySQL Workbench diagrams, as well as Snowflake queries and SQL scripts
- **React Native** - Multiple small mobile applications implementing React Native componenets, APIs, 
- **Java** -  Java development work from Eclipse including backend logic, GUIs, file handling, and more

## üåê Personal Website (WIP)
I'm also currently developing a personal website, deployed on Vercel, to gain experience with new frameworks, web development, deployment, CLI Git, and full-stack dev work, as well as provide 
myself with a one-stop location to showcase both coding and artwork/design work I've done. The GitHub repo this site is integrated with, and the site itself, are linked below.
